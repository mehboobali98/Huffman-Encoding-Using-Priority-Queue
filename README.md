# Ternary Huffman Encoding Using Priority Query

A modified Huffman algorithm is implemented for compressing sequences of characters from an alphabet of size n, where the characters
occur with known frequencies f1, f2, â€¦, fn. The algorithm encodes each character with a variable-length code word over the values 0, 1, 2 such that no code word is a prefix of another code word and so as to obtain the maximum possible compression.

## Time Complexity

To count the frequency of each character in the alphabet, count sort is used which takes O (N). Priority Queue operations take O (log N) time and these are called in a loop for n/2 characters. Therefore, the overall time complexity would be O (N log N).
